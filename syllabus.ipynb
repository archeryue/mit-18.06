    "1. Solving Ax = b for square systems by elimination (pivots, multipliers, back substitution, invertibility of A, factorization into A = LU)\n",
    "1. Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A, nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax = 0 from row reduced R)\n",
    "1. Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)\n",
    "1. Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)\n",
    "1. Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)\n",
    "1. Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum over all n! permutations, applications to inv(A) and volume)\n",
    "1. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and matrix exponentials to solve difference and differential equations)\n",
    "1. Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for x'Ax > 0, applications)\n",
    "1. Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases that diagonalize A)\n",
    "1. Linear algebra in engineering (graphs and networks, Markov matrices, Fourier matrix, Fast Fourier Transform, linear programming)"
